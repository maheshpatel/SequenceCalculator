# SequenceCalculator
This project contains the Web repository to calculate sequence numbers.

Please Note : Due to issues with npm on my local machine, I wasn't able to download packages and as a result unable to test and improve look and feel. 

To Run the application 

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
